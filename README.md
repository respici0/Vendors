# Vendors
Track your local vendors 

This is one of the current projects I am working on. Since the legalization of street vendors in LA, I am making a website that will use 
geolocation to find your position and then track local vendors in your immediate area. Currently I am using YELPS API to track food tracks.
Since this concept is fairly new, there are no known API's to track local vendors that aren't in a truck but I will be working on that shortly.
